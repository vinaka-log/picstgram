This is a Web service where you can easily ask questions about Japan. You can share small questions about Japanese and recommended sightseeing spots.

## Why "Shitsumon Wa?" service?

- “I like Japan, but it costs money to come to study in Japan.” (Azerbaijani man in his early twenties)
- "I often travel to Japan, so I want to know the spots where local people go, not famous tourist spots." (Middle 20s Hong Kong woman)
- "I am self-taught because my Japanese lessons have disappeared in Corona, but I want a place where I can feel free to ask questions because the grammar of Japanese is difficult." (Russian women in their early thirties)

From the opinions of my friends above, I knew that there was a need for a service that could share information about Japan, and I thought that having a service close to me would help my friends deepen their understanding of Japan.
